Bitesized Website</title><link>https://tlocrt.com/other/web/bitesized_website/</link><guid>https://tlocrt.com/other/web/bitesized_website/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>I created another website, this time for Bitesized. This one was was considerably less work than the <a href="https://tlocrt.com/other/web/tlocrt_website/">tlocrt website</a>.
I had some more skillz this time around and I could reuse the theme I had already built.</p>
<p>Since most of the Bitesized cover art is greyscale, I went with a simple greyscale look.</p>
<p>Bitesized is a DIY band. I tried conveying this by using a handwritten font in the headers and by incorporating custom handwritten letters in the logo.</p>
<p>Website features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a rectangle animation when a user hovers over links</li>
<li>social media icons</li>
<li>a scaling animation when a user hovers over social media icons</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favourite parts is how the simplified logo in the favicon turned out.</p>

One day, after spotting one of its leaves that had fallen off, I felt inspired to paint something plant-related.</p>

<p>I found the combination of bright greens in younger leaves, the deep dark greens in mature ones, and the yellowish-brown colour of an occasional dead leaf interesting. Since I had three canvases, I tried painting something resembling three stages of a plant&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Getting the colours right took some trial and error.</p>

<p>In the end, I found it especially cool how the partially mixed green-yellow-black-with-a-tiny-bit-of-brown in the middle painting turned out.</p>

She wanted a tank top with longer sides, similar to one she already has.</p>
<p>The most challenging part of this project was the bottom hem. Since the sides are longer, the bottom edges were not perpendicular to the side seam. I had to improvise sewing those corners, but they turned out not too bad.</p>

Since I was a web development noob, it took a small eternity. But it was fun!</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re seeing is a custom Hugo theme, developed by following the first ~1/3 of the helpful book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/build-websites-with-hugo/"><em>Build Websites with Hugo</em></a> by Brian P. Hogan and then freestyling (aka typing semi-coherent questions into various search engines and LLMs until something started working).</p>
<h2 id="whats-up-with-the-name">What&rsquo;s up with the name?</h2>
<p>The word &ldquo;tlocrt&rdquo; (pronounced tlotsrt) means &ldquo;ground plan&rdquo; in Serbo-Croatian.
I picked it mainly because I liked how the word looked &mdash; it&rsquo;s kind of symmetric, but also not really.
Also it&rsquo;s not easy to find a cool domain name in 2024 that is also available&hellip;</p>
<p>The logo was inspired by the meaning of the word and contains artistic interpretations of elements of technical drawings.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Features that took way more time than they should have include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serving a downsized version of all images (unless the user clicks on an image &mdash; then they get all the pixels).</li>
<li>Responsive design (this means that things will be positioned and scaled differently, depending on your screen size).</li>
<li>Automatically generated &ldquo;Latest&rdquo; section on the homepage (the secret sauce was using <code>.Site.RegularPages</code> instead of <code>.Site.Pages</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>Every time I work on the website, I get many wonderful ideas of what I can do next, all of which I promptly forget the moment I stop working on it.</p>
<p>Cue: a TODO list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the fonts (do they even work?)</li>
<li>Try increasing the content div on mobile</li>
<li>Make priority lists nicer</li>
</ul>

When I saw the beautiful Arturia MiniLab 3 Alpine White, I knew that was the one.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to be able to take it places and since <del>I had some curtain leftovers</del> its beauty had to be protected, I decided to make a soft case for it.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge in the design process was figuring out how to deal with the protruding knobs and faders.</p>

<p>After a number of hours of overthinking the design, I went with the classic messenger bag style and a sponge insert that goes over the keys and the pads.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with how it turned out. Here is one last pic of the case &ldquo;in action&rdquo;.</p>

Noise</title><link>https://tlocrt.com/visual/digital_art/noise/</link><guid>https://tlocrt.com/visual/digital_art/noise/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>At some point, I stumbled upon the gorgeous animations created by <a href="https://bleuje.com/">Bleuje</a>. According to the FAQ on the website, the animations were created in Processing, so I was inspired to try it out.</p>
<p>Noise is the third idea I tried (and the first one I thought looked kinda cool).</p>
<p>It was a fun little project and it made me appreciate Bleuje&rsquo;s work even more.</p>
<p>Below is the code for Noise.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>int spacer;
int line_length = 50;
int n_cols = 100;

void setup() {
  size(1024, 1024);

  spacer = width / n_cols;
  strokeWeight(1);
  stroke(255,255,255,90);
  noLoop();  // Run once and stop
}

void draw() {
  background(0);

  for (int y = spacer/2; y &lt; height; y += spacer) {
    for (int x = spacer/2; x &lt; width; x += spacer) {
      float angle = random(PI);

      line(
        x - line_length*cos(angle), 
        y - line_length*sin(angle), 
        x + line_length*cos(angle),

<p>It was also the most challenging sewing project so far.
I had never worked with stretchy fabrics before and I don&rsquo;t have a walking foot, so it took some trial and error before I was able to get anything resembling a &ldquo;straight&rdquo; zig-zag stitch.</p>

<p>I also had a small accident while I was sewing a hem, which resulted in a small hole.</p>
