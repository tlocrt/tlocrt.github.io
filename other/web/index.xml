This one was was considerably less work than the tlocrt website. I had some more skillz this time around and I could reuse the theme I had already built.
Since most of the Bitesized cover art is greyscale, I went with a simple greyscale look.
Bitesized is a DIY band. I tried conveying this by using a handwritten font in the headers and by incorporating custom handwritten letters in the logo.</description></item><item><title>tlocrt website</title><link>https://tlocrt.com/other/web/tlocrt_website/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tlocrt.com/other/web/tlocrt_website/</guid><description>This website was created in Hugo. Since I was a web development noob, it took a small eternity. But it was fun!
What you&amp;rsquo;re seeing is a custom Hugo theme, developed by following the first ~1/3 of the helpful book Build Websites with Hugo by Brian P. Hogan and then freestyling (aka typing semi-coherent questions into various search engines and LLMs until something started working).
Here is a picture of what the homepage looked like in September 2024.</description></item></channel></rss>
