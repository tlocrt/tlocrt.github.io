Since I was a web development noob, it took a small eternity. But it was fun!</p><p>What you&rsquo;re seeing is a custom Hugo theme, developed by following the first ~1/3 of the helpful book <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/build-websites-with-hugo/><em>Build Websites with Hugo</em></a> by Brian P. Hogan and then freestyling (aka typing semi-coherent questions into various search engines and LLMs until something started working).</p><h2 id=whats-up-with-the-name>What&rsquo;s up with the name?</h2><p>The word &ldquo;tlocrt&rdquo; (pronounced tlotsrt) means &ldquo;ground plan&rdquo; in Serbo-Croatian.
I picked it mainly because I liked how the word looked &mdash; it&rsquo;s kind of symmetric, but also not really.
Also it&rsquo;s not easy to find a cool domain name in 2024 that is also available&mldr;</p><p>The logo was inspired by the meaning of the word and contains artistic interpretations of elements of technical drawings.</p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><p>Features that took way more time than they should have include:</p><ul><li>Serving a downsized version of all images (unless the user clicks on an image &mdash; then they get all the pixels).</li><li>Responsive design (this means that things will be positioned and scaled differently, depending on your screen size).</li><li>Automatically generated &ldquo;Latest&rdquo; section on the homepage (the secret sauce was using <code>.Site.RegularPages</code> instead of <code>.Site.Pages</code>).</li></ul><h2 id=todo>TODO</h2><p>Every time I work on the website, I get many wonderful ideas of what I can do next, all of which I promptly forget the moment I stop working on it.</p><p>Cue: a TODO list.</p><ul><li>Fix the fonts (do they even work?)</li><li>Try increasing the content div on mobile</li><li>Make priority lists nicer</li></ul></div></section></div></main><footer><p>Copyright 2024.
