Since I&rsquo;m a web development noob, it took a small eternity. But it was fun!</p><p>What you&rsquo;re seeing is a custom Hugo theme, developed by following the first ~1/3 of the helpful book <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/build-websites-with-hugo/><em>Build Websites with Hugo</em></a> by Brian P. Hogan and then freestyling (aka typing semi-coherent questions into various search engines and LLMs until something started working).</p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><p>Features that took way more time than they should have and that probably nobody else will pay any attention to include:</p><ul><li>Serving a downsized version of all images (unless the user clicks on an image &mdash; then they get all the pixels).</li><li>Responsive design (this means that things will be positioned and scaled differently, depending on your screen size).</li><li>&ldquo;Latest&rdquo; section on the homepage (the secret sauce was using <code>.Site.RegularPages</code> instead of <code>.Site.Pages</code>).</li></ul><h2 id=todo>TODO</h2><p>Every time I work on the website, I get many wonderful ideas of what I can do next, all of which I promptly forget the moment I stop working on it.</p><p>Cue: a TODO list.</p><ul><li><del>Make the subnav bar less weird when there&rsquo;s only two items.</del> solved by adding a third item &#x1f60e;</li><li>Finish uploading the Lofoten pics.</li><li>Sometimes the subnavbar doesn&rsquo;t align well with the logo on mobile. Fix that.</li><li>Fix the fonts (do they even work?)</li></ul></main><footer><p>Copyright 2024. All rights reserved.</p></footer></div></body></html>
